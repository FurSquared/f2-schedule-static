DESCRIPTION:“Intro to Traditional Irish Music” is a hybrid presentation
  AND performance panel that takes the inner workings of fine details of tr
 aditional Irish music and explains them with accessible language accompani
 ed by live performance of various Irish tunes. The presentation aims to co
 ver and explain the types of Irish tunes (such as fast reels\, or slow air
 s) and how each is different\; and also bring a visual explanation of how 
 ornamentation is played on the Irish flute specifically. Attendees get to 
 enjoy both a presentation and a variety of music all in one.
