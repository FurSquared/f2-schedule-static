DESCRIPTION:Are you an up-and-coming twitch streamer who is trying to reach
  that affiliate status? Have you obtained that goal and aren't sure where 
 to go next? Maybe you've had some sponsorship offers and aren't sure wheth
 er or not they're a good idea. I am a variety streamer who has faced a few
  of these situations myself! I am here to tell stories and answer your que
 stions on what might or might not work for you and your audience. This is 
 a welcoming and encouraging atmosphere! We all start somewhere.
